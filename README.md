# CTIF

An image format for OpenComputers and ComputerCraft. See releases for JAR converter binaries.

To run CTIFConverter, you need Java 7 and a recent enough version of ImageMagick. If you don't have ImageMagick, install it from your package manager. If you're on 
Windows, unpacking the portable version of ImageMagick ([x86](http://www.imagemagick.org/download/binaries/ImageMagick-6.9.3-7-portable-Q16-x86.zip), 
[x64](http://www.imagemagick.org/download/binaries/ImageMagick-6.9.3-7-portable-Q16-x64.zip)) into your PATH, or the current working directory, *might* help.

If you want to make a JAR yourself, you need:

* JCommander 1.48+
* im4java 1.4.0+

If you just want to view CTIF files, see the viewers directory.
